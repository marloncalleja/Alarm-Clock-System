# Alarm-Clock-System

The application of a real-time-clock allows for the activation of a blinds opener module and a music player device when reaching the set alarm time. An LCD was used to display the time and provide interface to the user for setting the alarm minute and hour. The blinds opener module and alarm clock base station are modular in nature, they are controlled by an 8051 microcontroller and linked wirelessly through RF modules.

The 'source' folder contains the code for such implementation, schematics and flowcharts were added to 'utility'.

Further project details can be found with the attached write-up (PDF file).
